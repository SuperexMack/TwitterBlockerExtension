# Twitter Addiction Remover Extension

ðŸš¨ Just built a Chrome extension to keep my Twitter addiction in check! Here's how it works:

ðŸ”¹ You get 20 visits to Twitter per day. ðŸ”¹ After 20 visits, the extension blocks access until the next 24 hours. ðŸ”¹ The counter resets every day so you can start fresh without overdoing it.

Perfect for anyone trying to curb their Twitter time while still staying in the loop. Might drop it as a project soon! ðŸ‘€
